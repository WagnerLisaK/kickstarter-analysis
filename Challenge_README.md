# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project and Purpose
This project revolves around different types of productions and the related fundraising efforts.

Louise wants to produce a play.  She has historical data she needs analyzed.  The data includes productions of different types, from around the world, and spread over a period of years, 2009 - 2017.  The data includes, but is not limited to: Name of Production, Type of Production, Fundraising Goal, Total Donations, Total Number of Backers, and the time frame for which the fundraising occurred.

Louise want to know the outcomes of the fundraising campaigns based on the campaign launch date and also on fundraising goals.  This information will help her make an educated decision on how to manage her fundraising and if her budget is reasonable.

## Analysis and Challenges
To create my analyses, I,
1. Created a pivot table for which I could filter on "Parent Category"="theater" and/or "Year" for which I could see the number of productions that were "Successful", "Failed", or "Canceled" for each month.  The outcome labels were sorted so "Successful" was shown first.

2. I created the line chart "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" (shown further below).  This illustrated what months fundraising was most successful and which months to avoid.

3. I created and populated a table for the number of productions per campaign goal range, that were successful, failed, or canceled.

4. I created a line chart "Outcomes Based on Goal" (shown further below) that illustrates the percent of successful and failed campaigns per fundraising dollar category.

See below for chart-specific analyses.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
