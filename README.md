An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart. As you hover over each point with your mouse pointer, a tooltip appears with the corresponding information.

theater is a popular and successful type of campaign overall

there is a spike of successful campaigns that began in June, but that tapers off by the end of the year.

Foresight campaign was successful. It reached 100% of its goal.  The average donation is surprisingly high, considering there are only 17 backers. Scrolling further, we can also see that the campaign wasn't active for very long---just under a month.

For one, failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, so this isn't great news for her campaign. In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects. 

The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset.

The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center.

Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals!

From these plots, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
