1. The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. The 3 worst months to start a campaign were August, September, and December.
2. January, August, September, October, and December all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched as successful.



Below is chart comparing the type of campaign and its number of successes and failures.

1. Theater is the most popular type of campaign, followed closely by Music.
2. Music campaigns had the highest percent of success (77%) and lowest percent of failures (17%) with a grand total of 636 campaigns.
3. Film & Video came in second at 62% successful and 31% failed with a grand total of 422 campaigns.
4. Interestingly enough, Theater came in 3rd with 58% successful and 38% failed with a grand total of 912.
5. Journalism is a category to avoid, along with publishing, games, food, and photography.



From a statistical perspective,
1. Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns.  You are asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal.
2. The mean campaign goal is around £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000. You should set a goal of less then £4,000.



Foresight Campaign

The Foresight campaign was successful. It reached 100% of its goal. The average donation was $117.88, with only 17 backers. The campaign wasn't active for very long, just over 3 weeks.
